# TwO-O-Player Math Game

TwO-O-Player is a two player, OOP based command line application game, made with Ruby.

  Players take turns to answer simple math addition problems, with a new math question being generated by picking two random numbers between 1 and 20.

  The player who is prompted to answer a question, must answer correctly or lose a life. At the end of every turn, the game will output the new scores for both players, so players know where they stand.
